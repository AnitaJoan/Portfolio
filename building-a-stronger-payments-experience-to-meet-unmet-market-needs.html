            <p>
              Our client, an established digital payments provider in Europe,
              saw an opportunity for their digital wallet product in the
              emerging legalisation of online gambling in the US.

              >, we helped our client explore and visualise a new experience
              that covered multiple journey touchpoints from sign up in the
              payment gateway to using the app. The features conceptualised
              covered bringing the current experience to competitive parity and
              removing barriers as well as differentiating with budget and
              control features, all validated by research data.

          <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
          <p>
            The biggest challenge in this project was navigating the legal
            regulations uniquely placed on our client. Customers depositing into
            their digital wallet had to define if they were gambling or
            non-gambling funds. However the existing dashboard showed no
            differentiation of funds after deposit and the user could easily
            forget, try to make a gambling payment and be rejected by the
            gambling website. This initial question of funds intention was also
            quite jarring and caused some users to feel negatively towards the
            brand, like they were in trouble for considering gambling.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>OUTCOME</h3>
          <p>
            Our research showed users had a need to budget and keep their
            allocated gambling money seperate from everyday spend. Our client
            had a requirement that they ask users whether their funds were
            gambling or non gambling. As a solution to these, we created the
            concept of 'pockets'. Instead of one global balance, pockets behaved
            like accounts within the wallet that the user could name,
            personalise and most importantly, define as a gambling or non
            gambling account. This concept fit much closer with our audience
            mindset and no longer caused alarm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another interesting challenge was implementing budget control
            features into the digital wallet that could strike a balance between
            encouraging healthy spend and restricting spend. It was important
            from both an audience and a business perspective, not to recommended
            features that would restrict spend so harshly, the user no longer
            felt the money was in their control. After a lot of team discussion,
            we resolved that the budget feature should be akin to a friend
            reminding the user of how much they are spending and providing data
            visualisation to promote spending mindfulness.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>PROJECT RESULT</h3>
          <p>
            This project was very well received by our clientâ€™s product team. I
            had the lucky opportunity to co-present our findings and recommended
            product experience with my manager to multiple, c-suite
            stakeholders. Our recommendations were taken into our clients
            product roadmap and are currently being designed, tested and built.

            <h4>CLIENT FACING</h4>
            <p>
              I joined 3 on-site workshops with our client and was a key part of
              preparation, documentation and support during exercises. I also
              joined regular client catchups and presented works to gain buy-in
              from senior stakeholders.

              As part of executing the experience re-design and executive
              summary deliverables, I coordinated 3 UI designers at different
              stages of the design and maintained a project plan.

            <h4>IDEATION TO PROTOTYPE</h4>

              I was the lead on translating ideas into testable features on
              wireframes and prototypes created in Adobe XD. These were
              validated with guerrilla testing and results from client-based
              user testing.

          <div class="rectangle"></div>
          <p>
            This project helped me understand how incredibly valuable it is to
            speak to the people we are designing for. As someone who has a close
            family member who has struggled with gambling, this project made me
            initially uncomfortable. However it was incredibly enlightening to
            hear the stories of people who enjoyed sports, games and gambling
            and their various, homemade control methods to help them engage in
            betting safely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding the mindsets and habits helped me see the great
            opportunity for a payments brand to be an advocate of healthy
            gambling and enable gamblers to enjoy what they do without serious
            consequences.
