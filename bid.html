            <p>
              By interviewing entrepreneurs and intermediaries with previous
              experience with our client, we were able to capture and amplify
              their strengths and better match their brand strategy to the truth
              of their service: a highly specialist, human touch experience.
              This resulted in a brand refresh and new website designed for user
              needs.

          <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
          <p>
            Because we have to compete with so many old and established
            competitors, finding what made them the same and our client special
            was challenging. The breaktrhough came when we started to see
            patterns in how previous clients described the mismatch between
            their current website and their expectations of our client and their
            actuall human experience of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with a lot of our projects, this had a high learning curve as I
            had no understanding of Private Equity vs Venture Captialists.
            However much of this project ended up being about how to communicate
            with your fellow man.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>OUTCOME</h3>
          <p>
            Our client was quite skeptical of our methods in the beginning but
            we persisted and were able to show them an extensive research
            canvas, identifying white space in colour, typography, logo devices
            and visual language as well as what their clients would be suprised
            by.

            <h4>INSIGHTS ANALYSIS</h4>
            <p>
              I partnered with a UX Researcher to translate interview insights
              into analyses frameworks and insight summary canvas which we used
              to quickly communicate the meat of our findings to the client.

              Using the needs and expectations of our two user definitions, I
              crafted a first recommendation journey based on both customer
              insight and what good looks like in paralell markets.

              best in class feature stimuli to guide their design process.

            Being primarily a brand strategy project, this really taught me how
            applicable the customer focused experience frameworks I work with
            everyday are to de-risking projects. Whether its porduct, brand or
            process, the same methodologies and practises of thorough validation
            can result in a solid outcome based on truth.
