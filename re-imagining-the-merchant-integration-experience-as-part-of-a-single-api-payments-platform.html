            <h3>CLIENT OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>
              Our client, an established digital payments provider in Europe,
              needed an end-to-end understanding of what a good merchant
              integration experience looks like for their new single API
              platform.

            <p>
              Through extensive internal and customer interviews as well as
              competitive audits, we mapped their service and identified key
              moments of truth and friction. We then designed a best in class
              experience for 4 merchant personas, catering to each of their
              needs along the lead to live journey

          <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
          <p>
            A key challenge of this project was understanding the level of
            support and information each user required along the journey. In our
            research we found that commonly someone from Finance would engage in
            the search for a new payments provider while a CTO would sign off
            from a technical requirement perspective. As the integration
            progressed, a product manager would keep in touch with integration
            and a software engineer would execute the details.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project had a super high learning curve as I had little
            understanding of API integrations before the project and struggled
            to assess if our client had a poor user experience or I simply
            didnâ€™t understand what I was looking at. To mitigate this, we
            engaged in competitive journey audits to make direct comparisons
            with market leaders and then tested our clients experience with
            developers. This helped us understand that smoother, more intuitive
            integration experiences were being set as expectation by competitors
            and our tests helped us pinpoint where in the journey and why.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>OUTCOME</h3>
          <p>
            Much of our clients processes were still manual, based on legacy
            systems. To smooth out the lead to live experience, we recommended
            self segmentation and self support to alleviate some resource strain
            and enable merchants to discover if this was the right solution for
            them. We designed a questionnaire that would allow the Finance
            persona to take a first stab at the requirements, heavily supported
            by recommendations along the way, and then share the blueprint with
            his team for easy customisation. This would lead into creating a
            test account, personalised with the answers from their blueprint. By
            mapping both the customer experience and the layers of service
            provided, we identified onstage manual processes that could be
            automated for a smoother on boarding experience and a key
            opportunity for chat support to priority merchants.

            <h4>INSIGHTS ANALYSIS</h4>
            <p>
              I partnered with a UX Researcher to translate interview insights
              into service blueprints, personas and analyses frameworks.

            <h4>FEATURE ANALYSIS</h4>
            <p>
              We directly compared the journey and features of leading
              competitors to evaluate parity and conducted user tests on these
              journeys to better understand how these competitors were received
              by our key user.

            <h4>SERVICE MAPPING</h4>
            <p>
              Through a combination of internal interviews, customer interviews
              and user testing, I led the service mapping to help us identify
              strain to internal resources and how these friction points
              affected the user experience.

            <h4>USER PERSONA DESIGN</h4>
            <p>
              For our user personas we led with a user story driven approach,
              outlining user expectations, needs and motivations as well as
              which touchpoints they were most crucial to. I found this format
              much more effective as B2B personas.

            <h4>IDEATION TO PROTOTYPE</h4>
            <p>
              I was the lead on translating ideas into testable features on
              wireframes and prototypes created in Adobe XD. Using Protopie, I
              constructed multi layered, end-to-end view of a fully validated
              merchant integration experience.

          <h1>What I learned on this project</h1>
          <div class="rectangle"></div>
          <p>
            Traditional UX personas sometimes get a bad rap and I was keen to
            design user personas that were meaningful and actionable for our
            clients product and engineering teams. Working closely with my CSO,
            I designed a clearer user persona defined by the context of their
            role and the key things they would be looking for in this experience
            to satisfy their job requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            These were so clear and useful to our client I have a working theory
            that B2B personas are more effective if they focus on Jobs to be
            Done framework as opposed to traditional demographics.
