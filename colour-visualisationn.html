            <h3>CLIENT OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>
              Our client, large paint manufacturer, was looking to better
              understand what consumers need from visualisation tools to
              increase their confidence in their home improvement project. After
              poor reviews and complaints with our clients existing tools, we
              sought to help them re-prioritise their approach by taking a step
              back and understanding how their customers think.
            </p>

          <div class="text-bit">
            <h3>PROCESS & OUTCOME</h3>
            <p>
              We interviewed 22 consumers with interior painting projects and
              condensed our findings into a report covering mental models, pain
              points, motivators and needs. By addressing the perception of
              current colour support touchpoints and framing the research with a
              'Jobs to be Done' lens, our clients were better equipped to
              participate in our facilitated ideation workshops. <br /><br />
              I'm proud to say the success of this client project directly
              contributed to my promotion.

          <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
          <p>
            One of the biggest challenges was that our client already had
            incredible amount of market research on their customers. This
            included market segmentation, triggers, experience maps and more.
            What else could we tell them they didn't already know? However it
            was clear that our client didn't know how to translate it into a
            product context. While their siloed market research team was off
            generating insights, their product team was largely running their
            roadmap blind. I knew we would have to present our research in a
            completely different way.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>OUTCOME</h3>
          <p>
            We discovered two main mindsets a consumer could find themselves in:
            aspiration or execution. When consumers were in an aspiration
            mindset, they were shaping their vision based on a multitude of
            factors, desires and limitations. This phase was largely high energy
            and conducted digitally on sites such as Pinterest or renovation
            advice articles. Things such as the type of room it needed to be,
            social pressure, harmony with furniture and the environmental
            feeling they wanted to create, all impacted the percieved possible
            colour choices. Once the consumer tried to match that abstract
            vision with the reality of paint swatches on offer, anxieties rose
            in response to choice overload.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inspired by the book 'When coffee and kale compete', I decided to
            frame the research report in the 4 forces of progress: Trigger,
            Vision, Anxiety and Inertia. This approach worked really well to
            organise the otherwise overwhelming amount of insights we had
            gathered. Our client especially understood the need to reduce
            anxiety and inertia of colour choice. Thsi led to ideas of
            personalisation and self segmentation tools on their website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another challenge we came across was the inherent disinterest of
            managers outside of the product team in our project. The siloed
            nature of their business had led to a misalignment across strategies
            and our client, Head of Product & Web, was struggling to unite them.
            However our differentiated research report presentation as well as
            multiple ideation workshops sparked the interest and engagement of
            many stakeholders, getting them to debate and work together as they
            don't normally do.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>PROJECT RESULT</h3>
          <p>
            This project was very well received by our clientâ€™s team and
            contributed to the re-prioritisation of their product roadmap in
            alignment with other stakeholders projects across other touchpoints.
            While it didn't lead to the change management that they desperately
            need, it was a nod in the right direction.

            <p>
              I was the primary consultant and contact on this project, in
              charge of stakeholder management, insight analysis and workshop
              facilitation.

            <h4>QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS</h4>
            <p>
              Working with 1 other researcher, I led the majority of the
              interviews with consumers yet also took notes sometimes so that I
              could improve and refine my technique from an observers
              perspective.

            <h4>REPORT DESIGN & PRESENTATION</h4>
            <p>
              When my research partner unfortunately had to take time off sick,
              I stepped up to continuing our affinity mapping and insight
              analysis. Leaning on my design skills, I packaged the insights
              into a punchy and visual presentation which I presented to their
              team of senior stakeholders.

          <h1>What I learned on this project</h1>
          <div class="rectangle"></div>
          <p>
            I saw very clearly on this project the difference between market
            insights and behavioural insights. Ideally they are used in tandem
            with UX research to design a well rounded service that addresses
            consumer needs at each touchpoint, flowing seamlessly to the next.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second thing I learned was how much I enjoyed working on a pure
            research project, giving people the space to talk about their
            experiences. People just light up when connect with others and they
            feel heard.
