            <p>
              Our client, an established digital payments provider in Europe,
              saw an opportunity for their digital wallet product in the
              emerging legalisation of online gambling in the US.

            <h3>PROCESS & OUTCOME</h3>
            <p>
              This was a research and recommendation project that focused on
              segmenting the emerging US market and identifying behaviours and
              mindsets around online gambling, which led to a recommendation of
              the target segment with the most needs to explore with digital
              wallet features. This led to a follow up project in experience and
              product design.

          <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
          <p>
            The biggest challenges in this project were first understanding the
            nuances of US payment trends, particularly the affinity to credit
            cards due to rewards points and the high credit card payment
            rejection rate on online gambling websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            As legalisation was only just starting to take place and not
            consistent across the states, even gamblers in legal states who
            tried to make an online payment to a gambling website with their
            credit cards experienced their banks rejecting the payment up to 60%
            of the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this created a huge opportunity for a digital wallet to bypass
            this barrier, convincing a US customer to try a digital wallet
            instead of their regular credit card or PayPal required a
            significant value exchange.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>OUTCOME</h3>
          <p>
            In our interviews we uncovered 11 archetypes across 3 behavioural
            segments. While the archetypes defined the various and fluid mental
            models of the emerging US gamblers, the behavioural segments
            represented the main motivations, needs and level of engagement that
            exists in the market.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>VALIDATION</h3>
          <p>
            We validated our segments with search intelligence data and
            identified the target segment for our client based on intent and
            spend ratio. This target segment had gamblers who were frequent,
            habitual bettors who budgeted for this lifestyle. They had more
            needs to be explored by product design but by catering to this
            segment, we could also create a strong product for the other
            segments with crossover needs.

            <h4>CUSTOMER INSIGHTS ANALYSIS</h4>
            <p>
              I partnered with a senior experience strategist and a project
              manager to translate interview insights into behavioural patterns.
              This resulted in segmentation and identifying unmet needs as
              market opportunities.

            <h4>EXPERIENCE MAPPING AUDIT</h4>
            <p>
              I conducted a thorough audit of the experience compared to
              competitors we learned the audience were leaning towards and
              provided a view to our client they didnâ€™t have.

            <h4>MARKET TRENDS ANALYSIS</h4>

              Working closely with our researcher and senior strategist in the
              analysis of secondary research papers, I helped understand current
              trends and their drivers.

          <p>
            One of my key learnings from this project was how important it is to
            read between the lines of what people say they do. <br /><br />There
            is an inherent stigma around problem gambling and this causes a lot
            of interviewees to self report their spend habits on the lighter
            side of the truth. By crafting questions that ask the same thing in
            multiple ways, we can paint a more accurate picture.
