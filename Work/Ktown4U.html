          <h2>Redesigning Ktown4U for a Western Audience</h2>
          <h6>CONCEPT PROJECT - MAY 2019 TO CURRENT - SOLO</h6>
         
          
        <div>
              
              
              <h4>Brief</h4>
              <p>Ktown4U.com are a large online store that sell Korean pop culture merchandise. What makes them unique is their access to Kpop celebrities to endorse their products and promotions. </p> <p>Album sales from this website contribute directly to the Korean Album Sales Charts which are counted when artists are considered for awards.  </p>
              
              <p>My experience purchasing from them was poor. The language used, inconsistent design and occasional user flow dead ends reduced my trust considerably. I believe with a redesign, Ktown4U could be the leading ‘Korea to International Consumer’ website. </p>
             
              <img src="../images/KT/Website.jpg" class="topimg"/>
              <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
              <p class="quote">“Anita wants to pre-order the new ATEEZ album so that her purchase will contribute to the Korean album sales chart and benefit the artists”
              </p>
        </div>
      
      </div>  
      <h4>Heuristic and Analytics</h4>
      

   
   <p>I started my process with a thorough heuristic analysis and found information architecture, content hierarchy and poor checkout flow to be the biggest offenders. 
    </p>
    <img src="../images/KT/Heuristic.jpg" class="topimg"/>
    <p>Using a website called similarweb.com, I understood 48% of their traffic was direct and they had seen a 32% increase in visits in the past 6 months. Compared to their competitors, they were leading in visits. </p>
    
    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    <p>I analysed 5 key competitors, including Amazon. I found that Ktown4Us connection to celebrities, their connection to the official Korean album sales charts and their mostly positive online reviews had them in the lead. Their downfall appeared to be a lack of good content and pleasant UX. </p>

    <h4>Survey</h4>
    <p>I surveyed 40 kpop fans to check my assumptions. I was suprised to find that not many people browsed.</p>
    <ul class="survey">
      <li>85% know exactly what they want to buy when they visit the website</li>
      <li>60% preferred a website that feels and reviews as trustworthy more than the cheapest price</li>
      <li>48% cared if their purchase to contributed to the Korean sales charts</li>
    </ul>
    
    <img src="../images/KT/Survey.jpg" class="topimg"/>   
    <h4>How might we?</h4>
   
    <p>How might we elicit trust in our website?</p>
    <p> How might we make it easier for customers to find what they’re looking for? </p>
    <h4>Whats Next?</h4>
        
     <p>Design studio, feature priorisation, inital designs, iterations and testing. </p>
