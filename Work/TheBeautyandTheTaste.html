    <h1>The fine wine industry is like a members-only club</h1>
    <p>Getting into fine wine as a newbie is incredibly difficult. Fine wines are generally associated with special occasions but when it comes to purchasing them, new wine enthusiasts feel isolated from the industry.</p>
    <p id="quote">“This isn’t speaking my language…I’m looking for a benchmark, for guidance.”</p>
    <h4>PAINPOINTS</h4>
    <p>Navigating wine terminology and ensuring a purchase results in a good tasting experience. Often time is a barrier, when a customer needs a wine for this weekend but has read a lot to understand the difference between a 2015 Spanish Tempranillo and a 2012 Tuscan Merlot.</p>

      <h1>The Beauty and the Taste</h1>
    <p>The Beauty and the Taste are a brand new online retail boutique, specialising the top 45 high-rated fine wines from all over the world. They believe that good stories drive meaningful purchases </p>
    <p>Claudio came to our team of 4 with his brand new ecommerce for new wine enthusiasts. He asked us to reduce his bounce rate, improve conversion and understand the target audience. </p>
    <img class="flowimg" src="/images/BT/BT-userflow.svg" alt="Original User Flow">
    <p>We tested his original website and 10/10 of users stated there was too much text.</p>

    <h1>New Flow</h1>
    <p>Firstly we ensured all paths led to a product page, cleaning up unnecessary SEO dead ends. Secondly, we brought clarity to the websites purpose, USPs and unique concept. We pulled out the most important facts for quick comparison between wines.</p>

        <p>The concept of beauty and taste was non-negotiable and was also the biggest confusion to customers.</p>

        <p>Team divide on the best approach and focus. </p>
      <!-- <p>Was it enough? As a team we decided to put our focus into the quantifiable results, focusing on clicks and user paths. We believe our efforts will make an improvement on our clients bounce and conversion rates. However, if I were to change anything, I would focus on the interaction and visual design. I believe if a luxury user experience matched the higher price, the concept of beauty and taste would contribute to conversion.</p> -->

                    <p>We created a simplified search feature as an experiment to see if reduced filter options would improve customer satisfaction in search results. Testing proved our assumption correct and users were a lot more confident with the reduced wine selection offered.</p>

                    <p>We gave both the Beauty and the Taste higher hierarchy and supported the concepts with a short paragraph. The buttons now explained the fundamental differences between both concepts; the beauty leading to search by region, and the taste leading to search by taste. But was it enough...?

            <h1>Outcome</h1>
            <p>In our short project time, as a team we decided to make suggestions we knew our client would be able to implement. Considering he was using Wordpress and outsourcing coding improvements, we focused on user flows, navigation and simplified content hierarchy. </p>
            <p>My key role in this project was user testing and rapid prototyping.</p>

                          <p>Looking back on this project, I believe we might have made a bigger impact if we put more emphasis on the visual design and interaction design of the website. One quote that stuck with me from testing was</p>
                          <p id="quote">“I expect the experience to match the higher prices”</p>
                          <img class="centerimg" src="/images/BT/BT-outcome-4.jpg" alt="Outcome4">
                          <p>By creating a unique way to browse that celebrated the beauty of wine and visualises taste, the concept could become alluring instead of confusing. With clear, comparable critic ratings, food pairings and key facts, new customers could feel welcomed by the elusive wine industry and see the beauty for themselves..</p>
