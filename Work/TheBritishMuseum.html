    <h1>Interactive experiences are the most remembered</h1>
    <p>How can we make the experience of the British Museum more engaging? This is a question my team and I sought to answer on our third concept project at General Assembly.</p>
    <p id="quote">“The Titanic exhibition was my favourite because I identified with a passenger and walked through the story to find out what happened to me"  </p>
    <h4>PAINPOINTS</h4>
    <p>5/8 museum goers mentioned the lack of linear journey to be the most frustrating especially when the artefacts didn’t appear relevant. This was closely followed by too much text to read. We observed this on a site visit where visitors engagement with text dropped as time went on. </p>

      <h1>The Concept Brief</h1>
    <p>Interact with the exhibits in some way.
      Learn more about artefacts they liked.
      Track what visitors have enjoyed and share those discoveries on social media.  Make recommendations based on visitors profiles.</p>

    <h1>New Flow</h1>
    <p>Firstly we ensured all paths led to a product page, cleaning up unnecessary SEO dead ends. Secondly, we brought clarity to the websites purpose, USPs and unique concept. We pulled out the most important facts for quick comparison between wines.</p>

        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p>Our limited resources for interviews and testing meant our solution would be biased towards 20-30 year olds.</p>

        <p>Testing our solution in the classroom and not the museum could skew results.</p>
        
        <p>We had just 2 weeks and so focused on a proof of concept.</p>
      <!-- <p>Was it enough? As a team we decided to put our focus into the quantifiable results, focusing on clicks and user paths. We believe our efforts will make an improvement on our clients bounce and conversion rates. However, if I were to change anything, I would focus on the interaction and visual design. I believe if a luxury user experience matched the higher price, the concept of beauty and taste would contribute to conversion.</p> -->

                    <h2 id="center">How might we connect artefacts into a linear storyline?</h2>
                    <p>We decided to gamify the experience, connecting 10-20 artefacts together in a scavenger hunt for facts. Users could select the period of history most interesting to them and work with a friend to solve the mystery.</p>

                    <h2 id="center">How might we encourage social sharing?</h2>
                    <p>Inspired by Snapchat, we included exclusive museum themed photo filters that only unlocked upon the successful completion of the game storyline. This tested really positively with one user stating:</p>
                    <p id="quote">"I'm absolutely sharing this on instagram!"</p>

                    <h2 id="center">How might we ensure users create an account?</h2>
                    <p>As per the brief, it was important to be able to track visitors interests and recommended new exhibits. We found placing the sign up after the completion of the first game to be most effective, directly after users had understood the value in the game.</p>

            <h1>Outcome</h1>
            <p>The result of this project was a proof of concept. It was recieved very well during testing and I believe the photo sharing would have encouraged more visitors to return and 'complete the museum'. With the sign up data, we could have understood the most popular artefacts and built stories around them.</p>
            <p>My key role in this project was user research, ideation and presentation.</p>
