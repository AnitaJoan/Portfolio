          <h2>Defining theblueprint.dev Training Platform</h2>
          <h6>CLIENT PROJECT - APRIL 2019 TO CURRENT - SOLO</h6>
         
          
        <div>
              
              
              <h4>Brief</h4>
             <p>The blueprint.dev (formally named Senpai Pathway) began as a simple website containing a series of coding exercises to help new software devs better understand new concepts. My client originally created the exercises as a response to his own difficulties in mentoring junior devs.  </p>
              <p>My task was to improve conversion, reduce the bounce rate and apply branding and aesthetic design.</p>
              
        </div>
      
      </div>  
      <h4>Initial Testing</h4>
      <p>Initial testing showed the biggest confusion was the target audience. Who was this for? My client told me he intended it as a guide for other mentors who could give his exercises to their own mentees. This was not getting across. </p>

    <h4>Survey</h4>
   <p>
        I conducted a survey to understand how mentors currently approach their mentee sessions and discover their current fixes and frustrations. I understood how results driven developers are, preferring actual solid learnings to general advice. </p>
    <h4>Interview and Personas</h4>
    <p>I learned from an interview with a current user that the USP of the site was not the advice for mentors, it was the unique exercises. We had two personas with very similar problems but required the solution delivered differently.</p>
    <img src="../images/BP/2.jpg" class="topimg"/>
    <h4>Project Pivot</h4>
    <p>My client realised he could target a wider audience and create more exercises. He envisioned this as a learning platform and a continuous career project for himself.</p>    
    
    
   
    <img src="../images/BP/4.jpg" class="topimg"/>
    <h4>Branding and Workshop</h4>
    <p>While my client revises his year old content, I am branding the website. </p>
    <p>In a workshop, my client and I arrived on theblueprint.dev as its new name. This is because the exercises are more like blueprints to career progression. After completing them devs will not have simply memorised code patterns but understood on a deeper conceptual level, the pros and cons of the approach. </p>

    <h4>Whats Next?</h4>
        
     <p>Secondary test results, iterations, hi fi design and launch coming soon. </p>
